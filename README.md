**Hi Everyone**

My name is Brooke and I live in Cleveland, Ohio. My favorite food is :pizza: and my birthday is March 15th, 1989. 
I love my dog, Finn. He is a Wheaten Terrier. :dog:


*Here's why I want to be a web developer:*
1. I want to work outside of CMS's and learn how to build my own. I'm sick of Wordpress! 
2. In today's society, especially in PR and marketing work, it's so important to know how websites are built, designed, and maintained. 
3. I beleive that this opportunity will open doors for me that will change my life for the better 
4. I love problem solving and have noticed that coding is an excellent way to hone in on my problem solving skills. 

*I'm a little nervous about:*
1. Some weeks my job is really busy and I have no time at all, I'm working until 10 p.m. and then exhausted. Worry that some weeks will be better time management wise than others. 
2. Sometimes I struggle admitting I need help or accepting criticism! Ah! :no_mouth:

*I know I'll be okay with:*
1. the communication aspect
2. dedication to hard work
3. Foraging for answers and staying on top of research and trends - I already do so much of this for my job
4. Perseverance - if there is one trait I do have from being sick, its knowing how to persevere through tough times! :thumbsup:

I'm ecstatic about being able to fully understand the world of web development. I know the challenge will be hard at times, but :star: **nothing in life comes easy!** :star:
