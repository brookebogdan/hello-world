**Hi Everyone**

My name is Brooke and I live in Cleveland, Ohio. My favorite food is :pizza: and my birthday is March 15th, 1989. 
I love my dog, Finn. He is a Wheaten Terrier. :dog:


*Here's why I want to be a web developer:*
1. I want to work outside of CMS's and learn how to build my own. I'm sick of Wordpress! 
2. In today's society, especially in PR and marketing work, it's so important to know how websites are built, designed, and maintained. 
3. I beleive that this opportunity will open doors for me that will change my life for the better 
4. I love problem solving and have noticed that coding is an excellent way to hone in on my problem solving skills. 

I'm ecstatic about being able to fully understand the world of web development. I know the challenge will be hard at times, but :star: **nothing in life comes easy!** :star:
